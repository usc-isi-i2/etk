WHAT IS DIG     DIG is a domain-specific indexing, search and analysis system. The DIG system harnesses state-of-the-art open source software combined with an open architecture and flexible set of APIs to facilitate the integration of a variety of extraction and analysis tools.   DIG builds on rich models of a domain that support fine-grained data collection, organization, and analysis. DIG builds a graph of the entities and relationships within a domain using scalable extraction and linking technologies.  DIG also includes a faceted content search interface for users to query DIGs and visualize information on maps, timelines, and tables.   DIG is designed to be scalable by building on open-source cloud-based infrastructure (i.e., HDFS, Hadoop, Elastic Search, etc.), supports a diversity of source types, and is rapidly re-targetable to new domains of interest.   Popular Science published a very interesting article  THE MAN WHO LIT THE DARK WEB: Data-mining tools are helping cops bust open online human trafficking  that describes the history of the DARPA MEMEX program that funds our DIG project, and provides details on how DIG is being used by law enforcement agencies to combat human trafficking.		       #digusc TWEETS       PEOPLE           Pedro Szekely   Project Leader & Research Associate Professor             Craig Knoblock   Director & Research Professor             Kevin Knight   Director & Professor             Daniel Marcu   Director & Research Associate Professor             Linhong Zhu   Computer Scientist           Mayank Kejriwal   Computer Scientist           Dipsy Kapoor   Research Programmer           Amandeep Singh   Research Programmer           Jason Slepicka   PhD Student           Majid Ghasemi Gol   PhD Student           Lakshmi Kasinathan   Student           Lingzhe Teng   MS Student           Muthu Rajendran R.
