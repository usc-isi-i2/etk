# In Spark <= 1.1, setting IPYTHON=1 would cause the driver to be launched using the `ipython`
# executable, while the worker would still be launched using PYSPARK_PYTHON.
#
# In Spark 1.2, we removed the documentation of the IPYTHON and IPYTHON_OPTS variables and added
# PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON and PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS to allow IPython to be used for the driver.
# Now, users can simply set PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=ipython to use IPython and set
# PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS to pass options when starting the Python driver
# (e.g. PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS='notebook').  This supports full customization of the IPython
# and executor Python executables.
#
# For backwards-compatibility, we retain the old IPYTHON and IPYTHON_OPTS variables.

# Determine the Python executable to use if PYSPARK_PYTHON or PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON isn't set:
if hash python2.7 2>/dev/null; then
  # Attempt to use Python 2.7, if installed:
  DEFAULT_PYTHON="python2.7"
else
