    rdfs:comment """October 28th 2018 revisions:
                    Corrected the domain of references_event, and the domain and text of latency and strength.
                    Added the regex pattern for latency.
                    Corrected causal: prefix definition, and added UnionOfEventQualifiedEvent blank node.
                    Corrected is_similar to have a domain of SimilarAssertion and range of Event.
                    Added QualifiedEvent and changed the domain of the latency and strength properties to reference it.
                    Added the references_event property (between QualifiedEvent and the actual Event).
                    Changed the has_catalyst/cause/migigating_factor/precondition/preventative properties' ranges to 
                      reference either Event or QualifiedEvent.
                    Updated CausalAssertion and SimilarAssertion to reference the GeneralConcepts ontology.
                  May 16th 2018 revisions:
                    Added the strength and latency properties.
                  April 16th revisions:
                    Added the SimilarAssertion and is_similar object property.
                  Jan 29th revisions:
                    Added has_mitigating_factor.
                    Correctly referenced CausalAssertion (versus CausalExplanation) in the object properties."""@en ;
