    rdfs:comment """October 23rd 2018 revisions:
                    Corrected sub-classing for several classes.
                    Added ElectromagneticActivity, InformationGathering, InformationOperation, RecruitmentActivity and RecruitmentOperation.
                    Renamed DeceptiveCommunication to Deception, ReleaseOfPropaganda to PropagandaActivity (to expand its semantics 
                      and changed its subclassing), Preparedness to PreparednessOrCapability.
                    Removed MeasurementFactor since it is not needed (a TimeSeries is defined as CollectionOfEvents and can subclass
                      directly to define its semantics/use it as an Event, and a ReportedValue is related using meas:has_reported_value). 
                    Added PhysicalMeasurement to indicate a Factor that based on some TimeSeries or ReportedValue that involves a physical property.
                    Renamed/generalized EnvironmentalDegradation to EnvironmentalFactor, since its direction can be defined by the SeriesTrend.
                    Added many concepts from the ReportedPropertyHierarchy (which is removed) to guarantee that all semantics are addressed.
                    Changed some equivalentClass definitions to subClassOf, and updated descriptions/comments.
                    Removed Marriage (the ceremony) since Wedding is equivalent. 
                    Added Oligarchy to the GovernmentalFactors (Democracy and Autocracy).
                    Commented out references to cco:, oeevent: and oeceo: classes that are only used in equivalencies and sub-class declarations. 
                    Removed ontology history older than 6 months. 
                  September 25th 2018 revisions:
                    Corrected IntenseOrStrong (for Famine) to be StrongOrIntense.
                    Removed LocationChange subclassing from Pilgrimage (since it is inherited).
                    Added Starvation (subclass of Death).
                    Updated the description of ArrestOrDetention.
                  August 23rd 2018 revisions:
                    Added the classes, Imprisonment, Illness, Injury and Wounding. Renamed IllnessOrWounding to IllnessOrInjury.
                    Removed PoliticalCorruption, CollectingOrRallying (added RallyingSupport and RallyingOpposition) and Complaint.
                    Changed the equivalency definition for DemonstrationOrProtest (to a subclass relationship).
                    Clarified the definitions of Voting, Election, MassKilling and EthnicCleansing and changed the subclassing 
                      of EthnicCleansing.
                  August 3rd 2018 revisions:
                    Removed the class, SafetyOrSecurity, in lieu of FeelingSafeOrSecure. Added the class, FeelingUnsafeOrInsecure.
                    Added more general Transparency and Secrecy classes, super-classes of EconomicXxx and PoliticalXxx.
                    Added the import of the Event ontology, for completeness.
                  July 10th 2018 revisions:
                    Changed subclassing (where it was for documentation) involving CCO and OE classes, to a comment.
                  June 27th 2018 revision:
                    Shortened the comments.
                    Corrected typos and changed the subclassing of several AgreementOrPromise subclasses to FormalAgreement.
                    Corrected the class definitions to be ordered alphabetically. Added the class, Accident.
                    Corrected the spelling of ConfiscationDamageOrDestruction. Added classes referenced in Issue #124 
                      (including AdequateSupply).
                    Removed *Available/NotAvailable since Excess, Shortage and AdequateSupply can be used.
                    Added HeadquartersOrBaseEstablished, AgriculturalEvents and ExploitationOfNaturalResources classes.
                    Corrected/clarified the comments of many classes. Changed sub-classing of CriminalAct and ExtraJudicialExecution.
                    Returned Confession to the list of sub-classes of Event.
                    Added HumanitarianCrisis and EconomicFactor (and subclassed EconomicCondition from it).
                    Updated the comments for Change, Increase/Decrease and Stasis.
                    Added the GoverningDirective sub-class of Factor and updated CommunicationConveyingEmotion to subclass 
                      from Communication.
                    Added subclassing from Event for the new classes added on April 20th (to support CAMEO and ACE mappings).
                  April 20th 2018 revisions:
                    Added new classes representing the union of existing concepts to map the CAMEO and ACE concepts.
                    Removed import of Event namespace, since this ontology uses the Event namespace.
                    Added AmassingAndStockpiling class, and updated the comments for the Change, Decrease, Increase and Stasis."""@en ;

The Event's classification (for example, AidOrReliefOrganization) or general:position_or_role property defines the Groups'/Organizations' function (e.g., 'peacekeeper', 'inspector', 'observer', etc.). In addition, a Person may be expelled/banished (for example, from a country), or ousted from a position. The former is conveyed by an Event which is a type of Expulsion and ForcedMove (as above), where the Event's affected actor is the Person. The latter is conveyed by an Event which is a type of Expulsion only, where the Person is the affected actor, and the Event's general:position_or_role property indicates the position from which they were removed. That position/role may be very specific (e.g., 'President') or very generic (e.g., 'Job'), depending on what is known about the Event."@en ;
