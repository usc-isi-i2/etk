    rdfs:comment """October 27th 2018 revisions:
                    Corrected regex pattern for data_created/modified.
                    Added the UserInput class, and the trigger_words, pronoun_mention, proper_name_mention and common_noun_mention 
                      datatype properties (preparing to deprecate MentionSpan, MentionTabularReference, MentionType and has_mention_type). 
                    Modified the sourced_from property's range to include UserInput.
                    Commented out references to prov: and dcterms: classes and properties that are only used in equivalencies and 
                      sub-class or sub-property declarations. 
                    Reduced the prefixes and imports to those that are explicitly referenced.
                    Removed ontology history older than 6 months.
                  September 24th 2018 revisions:
                    Added FunctionalProperty to time_retrieved.
                    Changed xsd:long to the more generic xsd:integer.
                    Added Seed to the domain list for author. Changed all rdfs:Literals to xsd:string.
                    Changed the text of the description/comment for time_completed.
                  August 3rd 2018 revisions:
                    Moved the equivalentClass definition for Document to the EventArtifact ontology (to avoid cyclic imports).
                  July 29th 2018 revisions:
                    Added the seed_type and citation datatype properties. 
                    Modified the definition of generated_by to add the range of Organization, which modifies the semantic from
                      that defined by W3C prov, wasGeneratedBy.
                    Added owl:FunctionalProperty to several properties, and updated the comments of several entities.
                  June 11th 2018 revisions:
                    Added a domain to text_value.
                    Added classes and properties to capture seed information so that it is queriable in the ontology store. 
                    Added text to the Worksheet class to describe how to identify the sheet (via its rdfs:label).
                    Added the property, online_source, and updated the comments for original_source and time_retrieved.
                  April 16th 2018 revisions:
                    Added the Worksheet class. Removed the fabio prefix since it is not used.
                    Modified the domain of time_completed to be any activity."""@en ;
