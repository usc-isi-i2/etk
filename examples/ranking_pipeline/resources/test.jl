The rare gesture from a senior official reflected the North's efforts to work toward a political détente on the Korean Peninsula that Kim Jong-un helped start in February by sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.<br /><br />  Still, the apology was all the more striking not only because the totalitarian state does not have a free press but also because it came from Kim Yong-chol, an army general considered hard-line even by North Korean standards.<br /><br />  He is widely believed in the South to have masterminded the sinking of a South Korean Navy ship in 2010, when he served as director of the North's main spy agency.

On Monday, Kim Yong-chol explained that the minders had been overruled by Kim Jong-un's bodyguards. The vice chairman apologized for the lack of coordination between different branches of the Pyongyang government.<br /><br />  After North Korea conducted a series of nuclear and missile tests last year that increased tensions, Kim Jong-un has shifted to dialogue in recent months. He has agreed to meet with South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, on April 27, and has offered to sit down with President Trump. Mr. Trump has agreed to do so by May, in an attempt to persuade him to give up his nuclear weapons.<br /><br />  In the past week alone, Mr. Kim has stunned the region with his breathtaking pace of diplomacy.<br /><br />  Last week, he met President Xi Jinping in Beijing, for his first known trip outside North Korea since he became leader.
