This repository will contain our toolkit for extracting information from web pages.
It will be built in stages to contain the following capabilities:

* Several structure extractors to identify the main content of a page and tables
* A host of data extractors for common entities, including people, places, phone, email, dates, etc.
* A trainable algorithm to rank extractions
* Automated experimentation to measure precision and recall of extractions
